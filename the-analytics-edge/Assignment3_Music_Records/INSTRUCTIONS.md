The music industry has a well-developed market with a global annual revenue around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82% of the total annual album sales.

Artists are at the core of the music industry and record labels provide them with the necessary resources to sell their music on a large scale. A record label incurs numerous costs (studio recording, marketing, distribution, and touring) in exchange for a percentage of the profits from album sales, singles and concert tickets.

Unfortunately, the success of an artist's release is highly uncertain: a single may be extremely popular, resulting in widespread radio play and digital downloads, while another single may turn out quite unpopular, and therefore unprofitable.

Knowing the competitive nature of the recording industry, record labels face the fundamental decision problem of which musical releases to support to maximize their financial success.

How can we use analytics to predict the popularity of a song? In this assignment, we challenge ourselves to predict whether a song will reach a spot in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.
